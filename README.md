# PIPSQUEAK  
Mizzou Senior Capstone Project 2015  
  
Note:  	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)  Changed all the things back to a normal git setup.  I didn't like the PIPSQUEAK folder thing with nw.js outside.  
		New instructions! Read below  
  
Development instructions:  
1. Download and Install Node.js (Make sure "npm" and "ADD TO PATH" is selected in the installation): http://nodejs.org/download/  
2. Test Node by running "npm -v" (no quotes) from a terminal.  Should show you the latest version.  
3. Run "npm install" and all the dependencies and NW.js will install automatically (if not already installed). 
  
To run the application:  
On all the platforms: open a terminal and type "npm start" from the project directory.
